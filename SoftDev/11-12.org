* What do we look for (and what should we consider) in a new project?
1. Look at the README.md
  + It is all capital because back when files were sorted by their askii values, file names with capital letters were put on the top.
2. Changes
3. Todo
  + With GitHub, we can now use the Issues section in the projects.
4. Directory structure + File names
  + Follow the standard convention!
5. How is the file structured?
  + Make sure it makes sense and make sure it stays consistent!
  
** In your own projects...
- Make sure you delete functions that aren't used!
- Make sure your function names are appropriate (ex: is_valid_user() instead of validate_user())
- Try to put some comment blocks to make your code more understandable
