***** Paths are used to draw arbitary shapes, including circles and curves
- A context can keep track of one path at a time.
- The path is not drawn until stroke() is called
- A path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called
*** Functions
- beginPath()
  - starts or resets current path
- moveTo(x, y)
  - Moves path to position (x, y)
  - Does not result in a line or a filled in section
- lineTo(x, y)
  - Moves path to position (x, y)
  - Will result in a line and a filled in section
- closePath()
  - Results in a line from current position to start pos
  - Path can be continued after
- stroke()
  - Renders all the lines in the path, does not end the path
- fill()
  - Fills the interior of the path
  - Will not work if the path has fewer than 3 points
