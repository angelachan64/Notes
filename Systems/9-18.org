SOTD: Superstitious - Stevie Wonder

Aim : A vast array of possibilities

Do Now: How do you declare/use arrays in java?
Must use ./ before executable file if it is not in the directory terminal looks at to find commands
which <command> - find which directory the command is in
int main(){
  printf("Hi Everybody!");
  return 0;
}
Only two error messages
- more commonly: segmentation fault
Before running the c file, you must declare printf
- #include <stdio.h>
- also commonly used: <stdlib.h>
What is a .h file?
- .h files are similar to java interfaces
  - includes headers of methods
if int bob=7 and you want to say bob=7
- in Java: System.out.println("bob= " + bob)
- in C   : printf("bob= %d\n", bob);
If you want to print variables, you must include formatting placeholders in the string argument
| Type       | Formatting Character              |
|------------+-----------------------------------|
| int        | %d                                |
| long       | %ld                               |
| float      | %f                                |
| double     | %lf                               |
|            | %O.<x>f will provide              |
|            | x digits after the floating point |
| char       | %c                                |
| char array | %s                                |
| pointer    | %p                                |
