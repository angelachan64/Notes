* Server/Client Program Paradigms
*** Handshake
- A procedure to ensure that a connection has been established
- Both ends of the connection must verify that they can send and receive data to and from each other.
- Basic Handshake Procedure
  1. Server creates a named pipe (Well Known Pipe)
    | server |
    | ^^^^^^ |
    | This   |
    | is     |
    | the    |
    | Well   |
    | Known  |
    | Pipe   |
    | ^^^^^^ |
    - The server would create an upstream pipe because the downstream pipe would not be needed UNTIL a client connects and this could lead to other clients not wanted connecting to the pipe
  2. Server waits for a connection
  3. Client creates a "private" named pipe but does NOT open it
    - If the client opens the pipe, it will wait for a connection, resulting in deadlock between the server and the client.
    | server |        |        |
    | ^^^^^^ |        |        |
    | This   |        |        |
    | is     |        |        |
    | the    |        | pipe2  |
    | Well   |        |        |
    | Known  |        |        |
    | Pipe   |        |        |
    | ^^^^^^ |        |        |
    |        |        | client |
  4. Client connects to server and sends the private pipe name
    | server  |        |        |
    |         |        |        |
    | ^^^^^^^ |        |        |
    | private |        |        |
    | pipe    |        | pipe2  |
    | name    |        |        |
    | ^^^^^^^ |        |        |
    |         |        |        |
    | client  |        | client |
  5. Client waits for private pipe connection
  6. Server receives client's message and removes the Well Known Pipe
    |         |
    |         |
    |         |
    |         |
    | pipe2   |
    |         |
    |         |
    |         |
    | client  |
  7. Server connects to client pipe, sending an initial aknowledgement message
    | server  |
    |         |
    |         |
    |         |
    | hello   |
    |         |
    |         |
    |         |
    | client  |
  8. Client receives server's message, removes its private pipe.
