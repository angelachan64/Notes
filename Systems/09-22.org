SOTD: Hunger Strike - Temple of the Dog

Aim : What's the point of it all

You must compile & run from school computers

Memory Management
- Memory allocation either happens at compile time or at run time (dynamic)
  - compile time - stack memory
  - run time - heap memory (Java new)
- Compiler Allocated Memory
  - packaged with the binary of the program
  - There is no standard default value
  - Variables and arrays are allocated here
    - ex: float a
- Arrays
  - are not dynamic
  - must have a fixed state
  - there is no length function
  - there is no boundary checking
