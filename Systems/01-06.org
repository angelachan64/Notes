SOTD: Break on Through - The Doors

Aim : Cisco in an hour III: in 3-D!

* Data Link Layer (2)
- Point-to-point transmission between devices on the same (local) network
- Each device is given a unique 60-byte MAC (Media Access Control) address, this is set on each network card when they are made
- Data is packaged into frames
  - Ethernet Frame:
    | Description   | <prefix> | <dest> | <source> | <...> | <data>   | <checksum> |
    | Size in bytes | 8B       | 6B     | 6B       | 6B    | 46-1500B | 4B         |
    - Every ethernet frame starts with this prefix
      - 10101010 x7 + 10101011
    - destination/source
      - MAC addresses
    - ...
      - Information about frame type
    - data
      - If the data is less than 46 bytes, the data will be padded with zeros
      - Likewise, if the data is greater than 1500 bytes, the data will be separated into different frames
    - checksum
      - to ensure data integrity
