Aim: C what I did there?
Do Now:
   From yesterday:
   	4) Figure out what gcc does
	5) Copy woohoo.c from your home directory to a /code/ directory on homer
	   Assume you are not working on homer yourself
   Today:
	List the java primitive variable types
________________________________________________________________________________

4) man gcc
   man = manual, for any command
5) scp woohoo.c homer.stuy.edu:/code/
   scp (secure copy) from local to remote machine & vice versa
   slower than ftp (file transfer process) but secure
   can also say scp woohoo.c dw@homer.stuy.edu:/code/
       - You can omit the directory but not the colon and it will go to the home
       	 directory
________________________________________________________________________________

command line prompt: dw@homer:~$
   - dw is user
   - homer is server
   - ~ is home directory
