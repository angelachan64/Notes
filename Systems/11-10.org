SOTD: Burden in my Hand - Soundgarden

Aim : Invasion of the process snatchers
-----
* The exec family - <unistd.h>
- There are a number of c functions that can be used to run other programs from within our own programs.
- Replaces the current process with the new program, any code after a call to an exec function will be ignored.
** execl
- execl(<PATH>, <COMMAND>, <ARGS>, NULL)
  - PATH
    - The path to the program (ex: "/bin/ls")
  - COMMAND
    - The name of the program (ex: "ls")
  - ARGS
    - Each command line argument you wish to give the program (ex: "-a", "-l")
    - The last argument must be NULL
  - ex: execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-a", "-l", NULL);
  
** execlp
- execlp(<PATH>, <COMMAND>, <ARGS>, NULL)
  - Works like execl, except it uses the PATH environment variable for commands, so you can use "ls" as the PATH instead of "/bin/ls"
  - ex: execlp("ls", "ls", "-a", "-m", NULL)
** execvp
- execvp(<PATH>, <ARGUMENT ARRAY>)
- ARGUMENT ARRAY
  - Array of strings, with element 0 must be the name of the program to be executed and the last element must be NULL
- Like execlp, the PATH argument will take into PATH environment variable into account.
