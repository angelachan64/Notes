SOTD  : For What It's Worth - Buffalo Springfield

Aim   : I need information, stat!

Do Now: Make a directory

        Put a few files in that directory and maybe even a directory or two


metadata - information about data


stat - <sys/stat.h>
- Get information about a file (metadata)
- stat(<PATH>, <STAT BUFFER>)
  - struct stat sb;
  - stat("foo", &sb);
- STAT BUFFER
  - Must be a pointer to a struct stat
  - All the file information gets put into the stat buffer
  - Some of the fields in struct stat:
    - st_size
      - file size in bytes
    - st_uid, st_gid
      - user ID, group ID
    - st_mode
      - file permissions
    - st_atime, st_mtime
      - last access, last modification
