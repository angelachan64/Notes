SOTD: Paranoid Android - Radiohead

Aim : Cisco in an hour

Do Now: What needs to happen in order for 2 computers to communicate with each other?

* OSI 7-Layer Model
- Used to help conceptualize the different parts of network connections
- The top layer is the most concerete, with each subsequent layer becoming more abstract (relying less on the physical connections and more on code).
- The layers:
  1. Physical
  2. Data Link
  3. Network
  4. Transport
  5. Session
  6. Presentation
  7. Application
- If you are working on a particular layer, you should not have to think too much about the other layers
  - If you are working on layer 3, or Networking, you should assume that the physical and data link layers work
  - If you are working on layer 4, you should assume 1-3 are working and not worry about how 5-7 work
*** Physical Layer
- How computers are physically connected
- Things like electrons running across wires, radio signals pulsing through the air, etc...
- A brief history of wired connections
  - Thicknet
    - A single Coaxial cable runs throughout the network, "vampire taps" go into the cable and leech the data out
  - Thinnet
