SOTD: Imagine - John Lennon

Aim : Sharing is caring!

Do Now:
- Write a simple c program that creates a child process and have the parent wait for the child to exit.
- Create a primitive variable in the parent before forking, then modify that variable in the child and print it out in both the child and parent.

* Shared Memory - <sys/shm.h>, <sys/ipc.h>, <sys/type.h>
- A segment of heap memory that can be accessed by multiple processes that do not have to be related
- Shared memory is accessed via some key that is known by any process that needs to access it
- Shared memory does not get released when a program exits
- 5 Shared memory operations
  - Create the segment (happens once)
  - Access the segment (happens once per program)
    - Think: opening a file. When you open a file, you only get access to the file
  - Attach the segment to a variable (once per process)
    - This is two separate procedures
    - Once this is done, the pointer works like any other pointer
  - Detach the segment from a variable (once per process)
  - Remove the segment (happens once)
  
*** shmget
- Create or access a shared memory segment
- Returns a shared memory descriptor (similar idea to a file descriptor), or -1 if it fails
  - This is NOT the same as the key!
  - This is handled by the operating system
- shmget( key, size, flags )
  - key
    - Unique integer identifier for the shared memory segment
  - size
    - How much memory to request
  - flags
    - Includes permissions for the segment
    - Combine with bitwise or:
      - IPC_CREAT
        - Create the segment
        - If the segment is new, will set value to all 0s
      - IPC_EXCL
        - Fail if the segment already exists and IPC_CREAT is on
      example
        - int sd;
        - sd = shmget( 24601, 1024, IPC_CREAT | 0644)
*** shmat
- Attach a shared memory segment to a variable
- Returns a pointer to the segment, or -1 (errno)
- shmat( descriptor, address, flags )
  - descriptor
    - The return value of shmget
  - address
    - If 0, the OS will provide the appropriate address
  - flags
    - Usually 0, there is one useful flag
    - SHM_RDONLY
      - makes the memory read only
