Aim: Always read the fine print
Do Now: Open up your editor of choice (emacs), write a basic "Hello World"
   	program in java

Data Types and Variables
   Character literals are single characters inside ''
      ex : 'a', '*', ...
   String literals exist, even though there is no String data type
      ex : "hello", "you smell"
   C deals with String data type as an array of characters, followed by the null      character
   Any variable type can be declared as an "unsigned" variable. This singifies
      that the variable will never be ngative.
      - The lower bound of any unsigned variable is 0
      - The upper bound will be greater than the signed version
           * i.e. in Java, 255 is a short
	     	  in C, 255 can be an unsigned char
      - To make an unsigned char:
      	unsigned char x; --> 0<=x<=255
   Variables cannot be declared inside for loop statements by they can be
      initialized
      - i.e. in Java: for (int i=0;i<10;i++)
      	     in C   : for (i=0;i<10;i++)

in Java:
public clas hello{
    public static void main (String[] args){
        System.out.println("hello");
    }
}

in C:
int main(){
    return 0;
}
int - standard return type
main() - no parameters
return 0; - standard return value
no public, no private

gcc hello.c --> a.out
gcc hello.c -o greeter --> greeter
   - cannot run greeter
   - must say ./greeter to run it
