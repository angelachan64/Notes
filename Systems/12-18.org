SOTD: The last 8 songs on Abbey Road - The Beatles

Aim : Sometimes you have to ask your server for another fork

* Basic Server
1. Basic Handshake
2. Server gets data from client, "processes" it, and sends back a response
3. Once the client exits, the server recreates a new WKP, removes the old client connections, and the steps restart
***** HOWEVER, your server can only handle one client at a time!

* Forking Server
- Main server forks off dedicated subservers for each client connection
- Allows for simultaneous clients
- Handshake procedure is modified on the server:
  - STEPS 1-6 ARE THE SAME
  1. Server creates a named pipe (Well Known Pipe)
  2. Server waits for a connection
  3. Client creates a “private” named pipe but does NOT open it
  4. Client connects to server and sends the private pipe name
  5. Client waits for private pipe connection
  6. Server receives client’s message and removes the Well Known Pipe
  7. Server forks off a subserver
  8. *Subserver* connects to client pipe, sending an initial acknowledgement message
- After the Handshake
  - Main server creates a new WKP and waits for a new client
- Client does NOT need to be modified
