Aim: Ok, now we're really going to get to the point

The order of memory allocation is NOT sequential
A variable is a shorthand of an address
pointers - the fun really starts
- variables designed to store a memory address
printf("bob=%d\n",bob);
a[0]=10;
printf("a[0]=%d\n",a[-1]);
printf("a[-2]=%d\n",a[-2]);
a[-1] = 246
printf("fred=%d\n", fred);
printf("address of fred: %f",&fred);
& is used to get the address of a variable
* is used to declare a variable as a pointer type
