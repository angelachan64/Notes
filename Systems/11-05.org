Aid : Go fork off (another process)

/Continued from yesterday.../

- fork() - <unistd.h>
  - Creates a separate process based on the current one, the new process is called the child, the original is the parent.
  - The child process is a duplicate of the parent process. All parts of the parent process are copied, including stack and heap memory, and the file table.
    - A quick note on threads: A thread is a separate executable entity similar to a child process, except a thread is not a standalone process. It does not have its own memory space, but instead it shares its parent's memory.
  - Returns 0 to the child and the child's PID to the parent or -1 (errno)
  - If a parent process ends before the child, the child's new parent PID is 1.
- wait - <unistd.h>
  - Stops a parent process from running until any child has provided status information to the parent (usually the child has exited).
  - Returns the PID of the child that exited, or -1 (errno)
