* Network Layer (3)
- Data is broken into packets
  | DESCRIPTION | <header info> | <packet length> | <fragment info> | <time-to-live> | <protocol> | <header checksum> | <source> | <destination> | <...> | <data>     |
  | SIZE        | 2B            | 2B              | 4B              | 1B             | 1B         | 2B                | 4B       | 4B            | 4B    | 20-65,535B |
  - header info
    - packet type (IPv4/6), header length, etc...
  - fragment info
    - full payloads may be broken up, this will have total # of fragments as well as which fragment the current packet contains
  - time-to-live
    - maximum # of hops before the packet dies
  - protocol
    - TC, UDP, etc...
  - ...
    - optional information depending on type of packet
  - IP MTU is 65,535B
- IPv6
  - now 20 years old!
  - designed to overcome the limitations of IPv4
  - addresses
    - address space goes from 2^32 to 2^128
    - addresses are written as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits
      - i.e. 87ab : 301c : b251 : ...
    - All existing IPv4 addresses can be written as IPv6 like this:
      - i.e. 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : ffff : 149.89.150.100
  - MTU
    - ~4.3 billion (2^32)
      - Also referred to as jumbograms

* Transport Layer (4)
- Computer to computer connection over multiple networks
