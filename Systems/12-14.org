SOTD: Shinbone Alley/Hard to Exist - Spin Doctors

Aim : Ceci n'est pas une pipe (This is not a pipe)
*Pipe
- A conduit between 2 separate processes
  | a | -- 11001010101101011010 --> | b |
- Pipes have 2 ends: a read end and a write end
- Pipes are unidirectional (a single pipe must be either read or write only in a process)
  - In the diagram above, the pipe is a to b. If you want to make communication both ways, you must make two pipes.
- Pipes act just like files
- You can transfer any data you like through a pipe using read/write
  - In the diagram above, a would write to the pipe, b would read from the pipe
- Pipes are still interprocess communication but do /not/ fall under the category of posix or System 5 IPC
- Unnamed pipes have no external identification (like a descriptor or name)
  - This means that unnamed pipes cannot be used for communication between two separate programs
*** pipe <unistd.h>
- Create an unnamed pipe
- Returns 0 if the pipe was created, -1 if not
- Opens both ends of the pipe as files
- pipe( int descriptors[2] )
  - descriptors
    - Array that will contain the file descriptors for each end of the pipe
